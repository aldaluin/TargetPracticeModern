# TargetPracticeModern
Third person shooter at things that don't shoot back.

Master branch is playable production.  Only scripts that are actually used in at least the editor environment should be included.
Development branch is for code in progress.  This should include *all* code in the asset.
Features branch is to track non-essential additions that may be cool to have someday.
